/*- **Explanation:**
- **n = 1** â†’ "1"
- **n = 2** â†’ "11" (one '1')
- **n = 3** â†’ "21" (two '1's)
- **n = 4** â†’ "1211" (one '2', one '1')
- **n = 5** â†’ "111221" (one '1', one '2', two '1's)

 **Why Use Recursion?**
- The sequence follows a **self-dependent pattern** where `n-th` term depends on `(n-1)-th` term.
- Recursion naturally expresses this dependency.

---

 **Approach:**
1. **Base Case:**  
 - If `n == 1`, return `"1"`.
 
2. **Recursive Step:**  
 - Get the previous sequence by calling `count_say(n-1)`.
 - **Count consecutive characters** and construct the new sequence.

3. **Constructing the New Term:**
 - Iterate through the previous term.
 - Count how many times a character appears consecutively.
 - Append `{count}{character}` to the result string.

4. **Return the generated sequence for `n`**.

ðŸ”¹ **Time Complexity:** `O(2^n)` (exponential growth due to recursion)
ðŸ”¹ **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` (recursive stack depth)

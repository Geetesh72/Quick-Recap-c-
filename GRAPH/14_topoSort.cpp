/* 
ABOUT QUESTION:
What is Topological Sort?
- Topological sort is a linear ordering of vertices in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) such that for every directed edge u â†’ v, vertex u comes before v in the ordering.

Why is it applicable only in DAGs?
- Topological sorting requires the graph to be acyclic; otherwise, it would not be possible to establish a valid order of nodes.

Intuition:
- Use DFS to explore nodes, ensuring that all dependencies of a node are processed before the node itself.
- Push nodes to a stack once their processing is complete. Reversing the stack gives the topological order.

// DFS function to perform Topological Sort
void topodfs(int node, vector<vector<int>> &graph, vector<int> &vis, stack<int> &st) {

    for (auto it : graph[node]) {
        if (!vis[it]) {
            topodfs(it, graph, vis, st);
        }
    }
    st.push(node); // Push the node to the stack after exploring all its dependencies

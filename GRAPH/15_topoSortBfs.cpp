/* 
ABOUT QUESTION:
Topological Sorting:
- It is the linear ordering of vertices in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) such that for every directed edge u â†’ v, vertex u comes before v in the ordering.

Kahn's Algorithm:
- This is a BFS-based algorithm for topological sorting.
- The idea is to iteratively remove nodes with an in-degree of 0 while reducing the in-degrees of their neighbors.

Steps:
1. Compute the in-degrees of all nodes.
2. Push nodes with in-degree 0 into a queue.
3. Process each node, add it to the result, and reduce the in-degrees of its neighbors.
4. If a neighbor's in-degree becomes 0, add it to the queue.
